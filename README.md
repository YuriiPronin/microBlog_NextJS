I tried to create a micro-blog using Next.js technology.

In this project, you can log in, choose your role in this microblog (as always, I apologize for the design - it's not my strong point =))).
Author - can create publications and read comments from other users.
The commentator, in turn, can read everything, comment, but cannot create publications.
Also, by clicking on the name of the author of the publication, you get all his works.
Enjoy!
